				     <li>Academic Goals</li>
				          <p>I realized the need to complement
					  my technical and analytical skills
					  with a holistic understanding of
					  business management. I look forward
					  to the growth opportunities for a
					  person who is able to grasp the
					  bigger picture of the technology and
					  also understand the business
					  implications of the project. Through
					  the courses offered at NJIT as part
					  of the MSIS program including
					  Business Intelligence, Algorithms &
					  Data Structure, Business Data
					  Management, Machine Learning, Big
					  Data etc. I believe I can enhance my
					  innate qualities, equip myself with
					  the necessary tools to analyze
					  businesses, and expand my technical
					  skills, professional network and
					  career opportunities. Moreover, the
					  diversity of students that the school
					  has would definitely help me bridge
					  cross cultural gaps and would enable
					  me to enhance my soft skills there by
					  evolving as a global team player.
					  </p>
					       <li>Professional Goals</li>
					            <p>Earning an executive
						    position in the IT
						    department is my long-term
						    professional goal. Now am
						    heading to finish masters
						    to get into the business
						    analytics field. Although
						    healthcare is my preferred
						    domain, I am open to work
						    in any domain provided the
						    growth opportunities are
						    immense. In order to expand
						    the depth and breadth of
						    academic learning, am
						    currently exploring
						    internship opportunities in
						    my area of study </p>
						         <li>Internet
							 Technologies</li>
							      <p>The internet
							      technologies that
							      am familiar with
							      are: Java, C/C++,
							      Selenium, SOAP
							      UI, PLSQL/SQL
							      programming.
							      <br>During my
							      brief tenure at
							      Accenture I got
							      an opportunity to
							      undergo certified
							      training (GFT) on
							      SAP R/3 system.
